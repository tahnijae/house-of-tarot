# Tahni's House of Tarot

Hello and welcome to my house of tarot! This is my first personal project, and thus, my first Python project as well!

## Usage
Here you can use the mystic properties of the randomization to recieve a reading that gives you insight into your soul. Spooky! 
The current options for readings are:
* A three card spread
* The traditional 10 card Celtic Cross Spread
* A spread with as many cards as your heart desires!

## Roadmap
There are quite a few things that I would like to implement in this project in the future.
- [ ] Editing the print outs to remove the "s" if one card is drawn (ex you drew 1 major arcana cards -> card)
- [ ] An option for the user to cut the deck and decide which half to put on top
- [ ] Adding in reversals 
- [ ] Card meanings and / or keywords
- [ ] Adding more spreads
- [ ] Printing out the position number or name in a spread before each card 
- [x] Counter for the minor suits
- [ ] Maybe some sort of numerolgy, though I don't know anything about numerology so that could just be a print out if someone pulls 2 of more of the same number (ex: you drew 4 4s!)
- [ ] Beefing up the defensive programming (ie can't have an 88 card reading)
- [ ] Reorganizing classes out of main file
